# Andrew OS

Lots to come in here.

This is Andrew v32.

Semantic versioning for this is based on my life in `year.month.day` format.

To get the version number use time since I was born on June 20, 1986.](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=time+since+june+20+1986)

Example: 2018-11-04 is version 32.4.15

But how do I version over time and OS versions? Maybe I tag them independently and track them in parallel.

One tag is my age. The other tag is what version of my OS this is.

Release notes will be inteersting on this. "Life release notes."

- Age tag: 32.04.15
- OS tag: 0.0.1
