# Andrew OS

Lots to come in here.

## Versioning
Semantic versioning for this is based on my life in `year.month.day` format.

To get the version number [use time since I was born on June 20, 1986.](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=time+since+june+20+1986)

### Versioning example
Example: 2018-11-04 is version 32.4.15

But how do I version over time and OS versions? Maybe I tag them independently and track them in parallel.

One tag is my age. The other tag is personal OS version number, ex:
- Age tag: `32.04.15`
- OS tag: `0.0.1`

Release notes will be inteersting on this. "Life release notes."
